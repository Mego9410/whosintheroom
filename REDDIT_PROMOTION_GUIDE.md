## 🎨 Promotion Strategy: The 90/10 Rule

### **Phase 1: Build Credibility (2-3 weeks)**
**DO:**
- Create a personal Reddit account (not a company account)
- Spend 2-3 weeks participating authentically
- Upvote relevant content
- Comment helpfully on posts (answer questions, share insights)
- Build 40-50 karma before any promotion
- Read each subreddit's rules carefully

**DON'T:**
- Post promotional links immediately
- Use corporate language
- Pretend to be a regular user
- Post identical content across multiple subreddits

### **Phase 2: Soft Promotion (Value-First Approach)**

#### **Content Ideas That Work:**

1. **"I Built X to Solve Y" Format**
   - Title: "I built an AI tool to rank event guests by importance - here's what I learned"
   - Share: Problems you solved, mistakes made, lessons learned
   - Include: Behind-the-scenes building story
   - Link: Only in comments if asked, or in your profile

2. **Problem-Solution Posts**
   - Title: "How I stopped missing VIPs at conferences using AI ranking"
   - Share: Real pain points event organizers face
   - Include: How you approached the problem
   - Link: Soft mention in comments

3. **Lessons Learned Posts**
   - Title: "3 mistakes I made building an event management SaaS (and how to avoid them)"
   - Share: Authentic building journey
   - Include: Technical challenges, user feedback, pivots
   - Link: Profile or comment if relevant

4. **Answer Questions Naturally**
   - Find threads asking about:
     - "How do you manage guest lists?"
     - "What tools do you use for event planning?"
     - "How do you prioritize VIP guests?"
   - Provide genuine help first
   - Mention your solution naturally if relevant

### **Phase 3: Direct Engagement**

#### **Where Direct Promotion is Allowed:**
- **r/indiehackers** - Explicit self-promotion OK
- **r/sideproject** - Showcase your project
- **r/roastmystartup** - Get feedback
- **r/AlphaandBetausers** - Looking for early users
- **r/startups_promotion** - Promotion channel

#### **Post Format for Direct Promotion:**
```
Title: "I built GuestSync - AI-powered guest ranking for event organizers"

Body:
- What problem it solves
- Who it's for
- Key features (brief)
- What you're looking for (feedback, beta users, etc.)
- Link to waitlist

Be honest about stage (pre-launch, waitlist, etc.)
```

## 📝 Post Templates

### **Template 1: Problem-Solution Post**
```
Title: "How I solved the 'who's important?' problem for event organizers"

I've been organizing conferences for [X years/events], and the biggest pain point was always: 
"How do I know which guests to prioritize?"

We were using spreadsheets, manually tagging VIPs, and constantly updating team members. 
It was chaos.

So I built [GuestSync] - an AI tool that:
- Scores guests by influence, job title, and company
- Shares prioritized lists with your team in real-time
- Integrates with suppliers for seamless coordination

We're in early access right now. If you organize events, I'd love your feedback.

### **Template 2: Lessons Learned Post**
```
Title: "3 mistakes I made building an event management SaaS (and what I learned)"

I've been building [GuestSync] for the past [X months], and here are the biggest 
mistakes I made:

1. **Mistake:** Building features before validating the core problem
   **Lesson:** Talk to event organizers first. The problem they described wasn't what I 
   initially thought.

2. **Mistake:** [Second mistake]
   **Lesson:** [What you learned]

3. **Mistake:** [Third mistake]
   **Lesson:** [What you learned]

Currently in waitlist phase. Would love feedback from other founders or event organizers.

3. **Comment strategy:**
   - Provide genuine value first
   - Answer questions thoroughly

   - Mention your solution naturally if it fits

### **Timing:**
